abstract="Landsman and Maydew (J Acc Res 40:797--808, 2002) document that the information content of earnings announcements has increased over the past three decades, and Francis et al. (Acc Rev, 77:515--546, 2002) conclude that expanded concurrent disclosures in firms' earnings announcements, especially the inclusion of detailed income statements, explain this increase. We posit and find that the temporal increase in the intensity of the market's reaction to Street earnings offers a competing explanation for the Landsman and Maydew finding. We also find that expanded concurrent disclosure of \text{GAAP}-based information contributes to the temporal increase in the information content of earnings announcements. However, unlike Francis et al., we find that the temporal increase in concurrent balance sheet and cash flow statement information dominates concurrent income statement information once we control for Street earnings.",

 abstract = {A new method is presented for flexible regression modeling of high dimensional data. The model takes the form of an expansion in product spline basis functions, where the number of basis functions as well as the parameters associated with each one (product degree and knot locations) are automatically determined by the data. This procedure is motivated by the recursive partitioning approach to regression and shares its attractive properties. Unlike recursive partitioning, however, this method produces continuous models with continuous derivatives. It has more power and flexibility to model relationships that are nearly additive or involve interactions in at most a few variables. In addition, the model can be represented in a form that separately identifies the additive contributions and those associated with the different multivariable interactions.},

We find that the time taken to activate an analyst's earnings forecast in the Thomson Reuters Institutional Brokers' Estimate System is related to measures of investor demand for timely information processing, processing difficulty, and limited attention. Furthermore, we find that forecast announcement returns are muted and post-announcement drift is magnified for forecasts with longer unexpected activation delay and that market inefficiency is concentrated in neglected stocks and potentially exploitable. Finally, analyzing intraday returns, we find that activations facilitate price discovery."

month="Aug",
day="29",
abstract="This study examines the information content of quarterly earnings announcements, measured as the magnitude of stock price revision at earnings announcements relative to price revision at other times. We investigate whether quarterly earnings announcements are informative using a nonparametric approach and 1971--2011 sample period. The findings affirm prior evidence on earlier sample periods that significantly more information is conveyed to investors in the three days around earnings announcements than in randomly chosen three-day periods. Next, we examine the behavior of information content over our sample period and document four key findings. First, there is a dramatic increase in information content at earnings dates from 2001 onward. Second, the market reaction to loss firms is substantially less than that for profitable firms. Third, there is a significantly greater reaction to larger firms. Fourth, reaction at earnings dates is significantly increasing in analyst coverage, and once analyst coverage is controlled, the association with size becomes less significant.",

The author finds slow price adjustment accompanied by significant trading volume. During the 2002{\textendash}2012 period, 5,881 rule-based trading opportunities generated an average return of 1.53\% within four hours. After costs (assessed by a trading experiment), an investor who properly exploited the slow adjustment beat the market by 11.5\% a year. The slow price adjustment persists under various levels of investor inattention, limited arbitrage capital, and short-sale constraints.},
