This chapter will go over how to merge in data from various sources. This will include examples of how to merge in firm-level data from various sources, and time-series data from FRED/Fama-French Factors/CRSP Index Files.

## Common Sources of Firm-Level Data

Belwo is a matrix of common sources and identifiers that link across each database:

|------------------|:------------:|:------------:|:------------:|
| **Compustat**    |              | GVKEY-PERMNO |    PERMNO    |
| **CRSP CCMLINK** | PERMNO-GVKEY |              |              |
| **CRSP DSF/MSF** |              |              |              |
