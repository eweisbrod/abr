# Introduction

This document is a Quarto template for creating an academic paper formatted for potential publication in Elsevier journals. If you have received this document as a PDF, a live version including the code used to create this document can be found at: \url{https://www.overleaf.com/read/ctmwnmdcypzh}. I have added some material so that the tables and figures go along with the example Github coding project that I have created at: \url{https://github.com/eweisbrod/example-project}. 

% Use citet for in-text cites and citep for parenthetical cites
Here are some examples of in-text and parenthetical citations. To add citations to the paper, you must add the bibtex reference information to the ``Bibliography.bib" file that is part of the Overleaf project. The easiest way to do this is to look up the paper you wish to cite on Google scholar, then click on the "cite" link below the paper, select bibtex, and cut and paste the reference info into Overleaf. The bibtex reference will include a shorthand way to refer to the paper in the latex cite commands (e.g., "blankespoor2019individual"). \citet{blankespoor2019individual} is an in-text cite. There are also parenthetical cites \citep[e.g,][]{doyle2006extreme, livnat2006comparing,black2017non, Bradshaw2018}.\footnote{There are also footnotes. } 


# Bibliography styles

Here are two sample references:  @Feynman1963118 @Dirac1953888.

With this template using elsevier class, natbib will be used. Three bibliographic style ﬁles (*.bst) are provided and their use controled by `cite-style` option: 

- `citestyle: number` (default)  will use `elsarticle-num.bst` - can be used for the numbered scheme
- `citestyle: numbername` will use `elsarticle-num-names.bst` - can be used for numbered with new options of natbib.sty
- `citestyle: authoryear` will use `elsarticle-harv.bst` — can be used for author year scheme

This `citestyle` will insert the right `.bst` and set the correct `classoption` for `elsarticle` document class.

Using `natbiboptions` variable in YAML header, you can set more options for `natbib` itself . Example 

```yaml
natbiboptions: longnamesfirst,angle,semicolon
```

## Using CSL 

If `cite-method` is set to `citeproc` in `elsevier_article()`, then pandoc is used for citations instead of `natbib`. In this case, the `csl` option is used to format the references. By default, this template will provide an appropriate style, but alternative `csl` files are available from <https://www.zotero.org/styles?q=elsevier>. These can be downloaded
and stored locally, or the url can be used as in the example header.

# Equations

Here is an equation:
$$ 
  f_{X}(x) = \left(\frac{\alpha}{\beta}\right)
  \left(\frac{x}{\beta}\right)^{\alpha-1}
  e^{-\left(\frac{x}{\beta}\right)^{\alpha}}; 
  \alpha,\beta,x > 0 .
$$

Inline equations work as well: $\sum_{i = 2}^\infty\{\alpha_i^\beta\}$

# Figures and tables

@fig-meaningless is generated using an R chunk.

```{r}
#| label: fig-meaningless
#| fig-cap: A meaningless scatterplot
#| fig-width: 5
#| fig-height: 5
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: 50%
#| echo: false
plot(runif(25), runif(25))
```

# Tables coming from R

Tables can also be generated using R chunks, as shown in @tbl-simple example.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-simple
#| tbl-cap: Caption centered above table
#| echo: true
knitr::kable(head(mtcars)[,1:4])
```

# References {-}
